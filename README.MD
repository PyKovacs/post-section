# Post_section

Post section provides API interface to post, fetch, update and delete posts.
External API https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com is used to validate the user when posting, and to retrieve any posts not found in local db.

*NOTE: As this code is not considered for production environment, flask is only running dev server on local host, **therefore it is not accessible from outside.***
